# Superpowers TDD Execution Guardrails

Follow this for implementation tasks:

1) Read the spec/proposal and restate the goal briefly.
2) Work in small steps.
3) TDD loop:
   - Write a failing test (or a minimal repro)
   - Implement the smallest change to pass
   - Refactor
4) Run the narrowest checks first, then broader ones.
5) Keep changes scoped to the task.
6) End with:
   - What changed
   - How to verify
   - Any follow-ups
